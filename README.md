# flask-vendor
Simple app created with flask and SQLalchemy working on postgresql data base.

The purpose of this app is learning diffrent apects of Flask micro framework.
By picking up diffrent features to implement and overcoming obstacles by fixing bugs, learning a better way to use resources, changing my app model and trying out new extensions. 
I am working on gaining practical experience step by step the hard way.
